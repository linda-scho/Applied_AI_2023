# Applied_AI_2023
This repository contains the code files for the final assignment of the course Applied Artificial Intelligence at IT University of Copenhagen.

## Description
* **Notebooks**: The final assignment of the course is to complete and hand-in notebooks assigned in each of the nine lecture. Each lecture has one to three notebooks.

* **Course**: In this course, the students learn how to evaluate, design and prototype products based on latest artificial intelligence technologies. While maintaining a product centric perspective, this course aims at giving the students the ability to understand the different mechanisms at the basis of modern artificial intelligence and use this knowledge to design and evaluate AI based applications. After the course, the student should be able to:
  * formulate ideas on how to include artificial intelligence technologies in new products
  * analyse the impact of AI on the potential end-user and discuss ethical aspects of AI products.
  * describe the mechanisms that drive modern day artificial intelligence
  * compare multiple algorithms and identify the most appropriate for a given application
  * identify advantages and limitations of artificial intelligence algorithmscompile simple prototypes based on pre-existing library to experiment with AI methods
